                <h2>1. Oversized Outerwear</h2>
                <p>
                    Big, bold, and cozy—oversized outerwear is a staple for this winter. Think padded puffer jackets, oversized trench coats, or blanket-style wool coats.  
                    These not only keep you warm but also add a stylish silhouette to your outfit. Opt for neutral shades like beige or black for versatility, or go bold with vibrant hues like emerald green or deep red to make a statement.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Style Tip:</strong> Pair an oversized coat with skinny jeans or fitted trousers to balance the look.</p>

                    Chunky knit sweaters and cardigans are a must-have for winter. Whether it's a cable-knit turtleneck or a slouchy oversized sweater, knitwear is both cozy and chic.  
                    Layer it over a collared shirt for a polished look, or style it with leggings for a casual vibe.
